# Welcome to my weather application!

 ## My goal

 I want to create a simple weather app that asks you for your city and gives you a coresponding weather forecast.
 This goal should be achieved using clean, accurate code. No bells, no whistles only an API-key.

 ## Functionality

 For the app to function well, it seems necesairly to add both todays and tomorrows weather. 
 Heck, even a weekly forecast would be nice! 
 A simple click should be the bridge between. 

 ## Styling

 The color palet should adapt to the given weather.
 Besides that, I prefer a minimalstic view.
 Some icons should be give an easy indication about the weather.
