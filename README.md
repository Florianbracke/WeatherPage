# Welcome to my weather application!

 ## My goal

 I want to create a simple weather app that asks you for your city and gives you a coresponding weather forecast.
 This goal should be achieved using clean, accurate code. No bells, no whistles only an API-key.

 ## Functionality

 For the app to function well, it seems necesairly to add both todays and tomorrows weather. 
 Heck, even a weekly forecast would be nice! 
 A simple click should be the bridge between. 

 ## Styling

 The color palet should adapt to the given weather.
 Besides that, I prefer a minimalstic view.
 Some icons should be give an easy indication about the weather. 


## Result

 I am fairly happy with the result. 
 Functionality is good, styling could be better (as always).
 For a actually usefull weather ap, i'd need a more in depth API.
 
 Dividing into components wasn't actually usefull since I used only one main function.
